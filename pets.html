        <p class="petParagraph">
          I like animals, but I love pets. Much to the chagrin of my friends, I
          can't stop talking about them. This is especially true of the family
          pets. Despite not being the one who picked any of them, I ended up
          taking care of all of them, a responsibility which I cherish.<br />
          I think they are cute, and I wanted to show them off to you.

          Gertrude, or Gerda as we call her in Russian, is our oldest pet at
          <span id="gerdasAge">10</span>
          years old. She is a teacup yorkie, and is roughly about the size of a
          sneaker on chicken legs. She was selected by my younger sister Eva at
          a flea market. Despite her size, she is fiesty and protective. If she
          doesn't like you, she will gnaw on your toes with her two remaining
          teeth. Or she may sic Ray on you as her bodyguard.

          Rey, or as we nickname him at home 'Vah-Sya' (its a term of endearment
          in Russian), is our second oldest pet (<span id="raysAge">7</span>
          years old), physically though not mentally. He is a German Shephard
          who my dad selected after our old GS dog 'Kai' died. Rey is a very
          sweet and playfull dog. Due to a bad experience with daycare in the
          past, he was left somewhat traumatized. To this day he is very
          cowardly and unsure of himself, despite being a very big dog. He
          prefers to lounge around at home, and doesn't like going outside or
          meeting new people or animals.

          Stitch, named after the Disney character, is a recent addition to the
          household at about <span id="catsAge">1</span> years old. He and his
          buddy Charlie where selected by my youngest sister Maya. A
          rambunctions clumsy oaf, Stitch is a very friendly and explorative
          cat. He likes hanging around people, or from the tops of furniture
          where he knocks things down from because he lacks his kinds normal
          grace. He is a rescue, so our only guess is he is an egyptian mau.

        <p class="petParagraph">
          Charlie, named because his coloration makes him look like the big
          Chaplin himself, was also a recent addition. Also a street cat,
          Charlie was found alone as a very young kitten. As such he is very
          much a scaredy cat. It takes allot to gain his trust, but when you do,
          he is extremly affectionate. He is always found with his adopted
          brother stitch, and will go nuts if separated from him for more then a
          few minutes, which I think is pretty rare for cats.
